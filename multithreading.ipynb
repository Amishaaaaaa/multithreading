    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",

    "Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process, which can enhance the responsiveness\n",

    "the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Resource Utilization: Threads within a process share the same resources, such as memory space, file descriptors, and CPU. By utilizing \n",
    "multiple threads, you can make better use of system resources and improve overall efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Performance: In situations where multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously, multithreading can improve performance by utilizing the \n",
    "available processing power and reducing overall execution time. This is particularly useful in computationally intensive or I/O-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Program Design: Multithreading allows you to divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable threads. This can result in cleaner and more \n",
    "modular program design, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity into the codebase, as it requires careful synchronization and coordination between threads\n",
    "to avoid issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and data inconsistencies. Debugging and troubleshooting multithreaded programs can be more \n",
    "challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization Overhead: When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or condition\n",
    "variables are often required to ensure thread safety. These synchronization operations can introduce overhead and potentially impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficult to Debug: Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior. The interleaved execution of threads can\n",
    "lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to reproduce and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Resource Contentions: Multiple threads competing for the same resources may result in contention issues, such as excessive locking or\n",
    "contention over shared data. This contention can degrade performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Scaling on CPU-Bound Tasks: Although multithreading can improve performance for certain tasks, it may not always scale well on CPU-bound \n",
    "operations. This is because the number of available CPU cores can limit the benefits of parallel execution, and excessive thread creation can \n",
    "introduce scheduling overhead.\n",
